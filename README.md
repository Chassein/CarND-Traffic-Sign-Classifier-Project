## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
This is my first submission to the project: ''Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Classifier'' for Term 1 of the
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree of Udactiy. The code of my implementation can be found in Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb. My write-up is provided in Write-up.pdf. The tensorflow model which is used to classify traffic signs is stored in the bestnet files.
